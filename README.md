create a hash word_hash with key as word and value as count
Keep a sample text file
Read from text file line by line
take our each words and check if that word is there in the hash we create(word_hash)
if that word is there in hash, increment its count
if that word is not in hash, then create the word with count as 1

case 1: 
consider that there is only one line in text file
consider all the words are downcased

case 2:
avoid considerations in case 1
consider there are no commas or other punctuations
consider all words are in each space seperated
